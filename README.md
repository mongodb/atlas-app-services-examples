# Atlas App Services Examples

This repository contains examples of using [MongoDB Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/). App Services are fully-managed backend services and APIs
that help you build apps, integrate services, and connect to your Atlas data faster.

Currently the Atlas App Services examples just contains examples of [Atlas Triggers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/triggers/),
which you can find in the [triggers-examples folder](./triggers-examples).
